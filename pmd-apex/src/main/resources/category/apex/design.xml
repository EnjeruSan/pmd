        <description>
Avoid creating deeply nested if-then statements since they are harder to read and error-prone to maintain.

          externalInfoUrl="${pmd.website.baseurl}/pmd_rules_apex_design.html#cyclomaticcomplexity">
        <description>
The complexity of methods directly affects maintenance costs and readability. Concentrating too much decisional logic
in a single method makes its behaviour hard to read and change.

Cyclomatic complexity assesses the complexity of a method by counting the number of decision points in a method,
plus one for the method entry. Decision points are places where the control flow jumps to another place in the
program. As such, they include all control flow statements, such as 'if', 'while', 'for', and 'case'.

Generally, numbers ranging from 1-4 denote low complexity, 5-7 denote moderate complexity, 8-10 denote
high complexity, and 11+ is very high complexity. By default, this rule reports methods with a complexity >= 10.
Additionnally, classes with many methods of moderate complexity get reported as well once the total of their
methods' complexities reaches 40, even if none of the methods was directly reported.

Reported methods should be broken down into several smaller methods. Reported classes should probably be broken down
into subcomponents.

        <description>
Excessive class file lengths are usually indications that the class may be burdened with excessive 
responsibilities that could be provided by external classes or functions. In breaking these methods
apart the code becomes more managable and ripe for reuse.

Methods with numerous parameters are a challenge to maintain, especially if most of them share the
same datatype. These situations usually denote the need for new objects to wrap the numerous parameters.

        <description>
Classes with large numbers of public methods and attributes require disproportionate testing efforts
since combinational side effects grow rapidly and increase risk. Refactoring these classes into
smaller ones not only increases testability and reliability but also allows new variations to be
developed easily.

Classes that have too many fields can become unwieldy and could be redesigned to have fewer fields,
possibly through grouping related fields in new objects.  For example, a class with individual
