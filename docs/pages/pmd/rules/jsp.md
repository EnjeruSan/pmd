## Best Practices

{% include callout.html content="Rules which enforce generally accepted best practices." %}

*   [DontNestJsfInJstlIteration](pmd_rules_jsp_bestpractices.html#dontnestjsfinjstliteration): Do not nest JSF component custom actions inside a custom action that iterates over its body.
*   [NoClassAttribute](pmd_rules_jsp_bestpractices.html#noclassattribute): Do not use an attribute called 'class'. Use &quot;styleclass&quot; for CSS styles.

## Error Prone

{% include callout.html content="Rules to detect constructs that are either broken, extremely confusing or prone to runtime errors." %}

*   [JspEncoding](pmd_rules_jsp_errorprone.html#jspencoding): A missing 'meta' tag or page directive will trigger this rule, as well as a non-UTF-8 charset.

## Security

{% include callout.html content="Rules that flag potential security flaws." %}

*   [IframeMissingSrcAttribute](pmd_rules_jsp_security.html#iframemissingsrcattribute): IFrames which are missing a src element can cause security information popups in IE if you are ac...
