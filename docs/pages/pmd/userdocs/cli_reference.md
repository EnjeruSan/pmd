## Options

The tool comes with a rather extensive help text, simply running with `-help`!

## Additional Java Runtime Options

PMD is executed via a Java runtime. In some cases, you might need to set additional runtime options, e.g.
if you want to analyze a project, that uses one of OpenJDK's [Preview Language Features](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/12).

Just set the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` before executing PMD, e.g.

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS="--enable-preview"
    ./run.sh pmd -d ../../../src/main/java/ -f text -R rulesets/java/quickstart.xml

## Exit Status

Please note that if PMD detects any violations, it will exit with status 4 (since 5.3).
This behavior has been introduced to ease PMD integration into scripts or hooks, such as SVN hooks.

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Everything is fine, no violations found</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Couldn't understand command-line parameters or PMD exited with an exception</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>At least one violation has been detected, unless <code>-failOnViolation false</code> is set.</td></tr>
</table>
